Mulesoft_gateway (a API Management Gateway for RESTful APIs.)
================
The project should include a README.md that describes your design approach and provides any instructions needed for running the gateway. End to end tests that exercise the gateway are greatly encouraged.

Your gateway can sit between callers and any API - for example, you can choose to have it proxy some well-known API such as Twitter, Amazon, or Box's, or proxy an API that you write and host yourself, perhaps on a different port on the same machine.

At a minimum, the gateway should take all calls made to it, pass them on to the proxied API, and return the results back to the caller. With this infrastructure in place, only your imagination is the limit in terms of what is possible.
